- `draft_info.json` - Main CapCut project definition
- `draft_content.json` - Copy of draft_info.json (may be required by CapCut)

## Project Description

This CapCut project is based on the Buddhist story of Hakuin Ekaku (白隠禅師) and teaches about handling criticism. The story demonstrates how to remain calm and unperturbed when facing false accusations or negative comments, just like the wise monk who simply responded with kindness and compassion.

The project contains 25 segments derived from the original SRT file, with each segment approximately 30 seconds long. Each segment has associated text elements that highlight key moments in the story.

## Next Steps

To complete the project:
1. Replace the placeholder text files in the images/ directory with actual generated images
2. Add background music and voiceover audio as referenced in the draft
3. Import into CapCut and finalize the editing
