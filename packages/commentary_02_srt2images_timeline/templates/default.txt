Scene: {summary}
Visual focus: {visual_focus}
Main character (only if required): {main_character}

Style:
- Japanese illustration, watercolor + thin ink linework, washi-like grain.
- Calm, readable composition with a clear focal point.
- Soft lighting; avoid harsh blacks; low-to-mid saturation.
- No text, no signage, no UI, no logos.

People policy:
- Default: no people.
- If the script explicitly requires a person, keep ONE consistent character across frames and do not add extra characters.

Hard constraints:
- No photorealism. No anime exaggeration. No gore.
