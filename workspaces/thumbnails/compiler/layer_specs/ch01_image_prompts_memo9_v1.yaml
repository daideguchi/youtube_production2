      STYLE (LOCKED):
      Strong illustration look (NOT photoreal), Japanese ink + watercolor hybrid, visible brush strokes, subtle lineart, slightly poster-like shading, high contrast, cinematic lighting.

      COMPOSITION (LOCKED):
      Place the main subject on the FAR RIGHT, pushing to the edge.
      The subject must occupy the rightmost 40–45% of the canvas with NO extra gap on the right.
      The left 55–60% must remain open for typography overlay (but keep it dark and smooth, low detail).

      SUBJECT (FIXED for CH01):
      A powerful, dignified Buddhist monk, elderly, calm expression, shaved head, wearing traditional orange-brown robes, illustration style, strong silhouette.

      POSE / GAZE (LOCKED):
      3/4 view turned slightly LEFT, eyes looking toward the left text area, calm and dignified authority (NOT angry).

      CROP (LOCKED):
      Tight close-up (head + upper torso), large face, strong silhouette, head fully visible.

      LIGHTING (LOCKED):
      Warm golden halo behind the head, golden rim light, small ember-like particles concentrated near the monk only (avoid particles on the left text area).

      BACKGROUND (LOCKED):
      Near-black / deep charcoal background, soft smoke/mist.
      Very faint temple silhouettes ONLY behind the subject on the right side.
      The left text area should be darker and smoother with minimal texture.

      PROP (optional):
      Holding dark wooden prayer beads

      ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS:
      NO text, NO letters, NO numbers, NO watermark, NO logo, NO signature.
