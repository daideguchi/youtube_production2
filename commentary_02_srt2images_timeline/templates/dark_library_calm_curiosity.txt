You are generating a single 16:9 illustration for CH06 「都市伝説のダーク図書館」.
Scene: {summary}

Visual direction:
- Mood: quiet, mysterious, curiosity-inducing yet calming. Urban-legend library with subtle magic.
- Color: warm golden light accents (lamps, floating motes) × deep indigo/blue-gray stacks and stone. Low saturation, soft contrast.
- Light/air: soft bloom/halo, thin mist, floating dust/particles. Edges are soft; avoid harsh blacks.
- Touch: watercolor + light oil glaze; thin/broken ink lines; washi-like grain; gentle gradients.
- Composition: clear focal object or space (aisle, desk, glowing book). Negative space to keep it serene. Metaphorical motifs welcome.

People policy:
- Default: minimal or no humans. If the script requires a narrator/guide, use a single consistent Japanese/Asian face/attire across frames. Otherwise avoid people.
- No extra characters, no crowding.

Hard constraints:
- No text, signs, UI, logos. No photorealism. No anime exaggeration. No horror gore.
