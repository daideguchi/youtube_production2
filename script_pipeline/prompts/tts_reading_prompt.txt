Return raw text only (no JSON). Rules:
- Fix misreadings by adding furigana-style readings in Katakana/Hiragana where needed.
- Insert pause tags `[wait=0.2s|0.5s|1.0s]` after headings/major beats.
- Preserve meaning and markdown headings; do not add commentary.
- Never output English letters; convert them to Katakana readings.
