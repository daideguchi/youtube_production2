# Purpose: reduce "search noise" from archive-first payloads that intentionally
# contain legacy names / removed code. If you need to search these, pass the
# path explicitly (e.g. `rg PATTERN backups/graveyard`).

# SSOT history is intentionally archival and contains legacy names/paths.
ssot/history/**

# Cleanup execution log is a long-running audit trail; usually noise for code searches.
